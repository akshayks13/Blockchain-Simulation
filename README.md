# Blockchain-Simulation

This blockchain simulation illustrates essential concepts such as block creation, transaction handling, mining, and consensus verification. It features proof-of-work, transaction hashing, and Merkle Trees for secure verification, serving as a tool to explore and understand blockchain fundamentals.

## Objectives Covered
1) Creating and adding transactions.
2) Mining blocks.
3) Verifying blockchain integrity.
4) Simulating block propagation in a network.
5) Implementing a Consensus mechanism to maintain the longest valid chain.

## Features
1) Transaction Management: Prioritizes transactions using a MaxHeap.
2) Merkle Tree Implementation: Supports hashing and verification of transactions.
3) Proof of Work Mining: Mines blocks by adjusting the nonce to achieve a target hash.
4) Wallet Management: Handles user balances and transaction initiation.
5) Transaction History: Tracks user transaction history.

## Menu Driven Option
The simulation includes a user-friendly menu for interacting with the blockchain. 

## Prerequisite Knowledge
Knowledge about the general working of blockchain,blockchain mining and blockchain transactions is a must.

## Getting Started 
Run the script to initialize the blockchain, create transactions, and simulate network behavior.

## Hope you have fun learning!!
